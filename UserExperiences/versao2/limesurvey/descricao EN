Topic: Volunteers Needed for Perceptual Study on Rhythm

Greetings!

As part of my PhD research, I am exploring computational rhythmic representation and rhythmic affinity spaces.
I am currently carrying out several perceptual tests with the aim of evaluating different methodologies and, for this purpose, I'm looking for volunteers with musical training (not mandatory).
The tests are conducted online and last approximately 30 minutes at most. 
Broadly speaking, participants will be asked to rank a series of audio loops in hierarchical order based on their perceived rhythmic affinity between the two superimposed rhythmic patterns in each file.

The provided URL contains the survey and additional information about it.

At the end of the survey, participants are invited to leave comments. This feedback is highly valuable — whether it concerns any difficulties experienced, whether the task was enjoyable or tedious, or any other observations made during the survey. All such input contributes meaningfully to the analysis.

I deeply thank you in advance for your collaboration, which is essential for the development of this research.

Thank you,
Diogo Cocharro
