# CSV to Max

chatgpt

I want to use node.script to parse CSV files into Max9. For that purpose, there is a npm library named csv-parse that might help.

The script should read a CSV file and convert it into some usable format in Max9, for instance, the JSON format through the DICT object.





Max9 introduces a javascript v8 engine that supports ES6+ features. I want to use that javascript v8 object to parse CSV files into Max9.  The script should read a CSV file and convert it into some usable format in Max9, such as the JSON format through the DICT object.
