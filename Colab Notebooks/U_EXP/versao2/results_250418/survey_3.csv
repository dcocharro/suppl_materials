I believe this happened because I was not familiar with what I heard in these cases. I believe that lifelong musical education and exposure to musical diversity influences the way we perceive sounds. If it is familiar to us, we experience affinity and pleasure. If, on the other hand, the attribution of meaning is strange and not intuitive to us, if we do not validate the rhythm (and also the melody, harmony and timbre), we do not feel in affinity and, therefore, we do not feel pleasure. I believe that pleasure comes from a certain subjection to the expected. The sounds used in this questionnaire - Afro-Cuban percussion instruments - I believe can condition the listener's relationship with the rhythmic patterns performed. In my case, the connection with tribal realities was inevitable (due to some rhythmic patterns, but also due to the timbre). I believe that the level of knowledge and the validation or not of ethnographic diversity from an anthropological perspective by an individual, conditions the timbral predisposition. It would be interesting to do this same questionnaire using the same loops, but with instrument timbres associated with non-tribal music. Instruments from classical percussion, for example.
I hope this questionnaire will be helpful and that the objective of this project will be achieved. Best wishes for success.",2489.05,313.17,269.64,551.02,10.66,18.9,8.08,1317.58

I assigned first position to the one which I felt was closest to the base rhythm.

Sometimes I wished the loop was longer for the ones that felt more difficult to decide about. However, the longer I listened, the more pleasant all of them began to sound. I took long breaks between the three tasks (an hour or so).
