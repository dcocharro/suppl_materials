All rhythmic patterns were transcribed from G. Toussaint published work, except the subsets named "DC Claves..." which were transcribed from different sources such as, music education books, websites and videos.

G.Toussaint subsets:
- Maximally Even Rhythms 12pulses 4onsets in 12-8;
- Maximally Even Rhythms 12pulses 4onsets in 4-4;
>This subset comprises rhythmic patterns with the same density and with a maximally even   distribution property (a characteristic observed in many euclidean rhythms).

- Toussaint Mixed in 4-4;
- Toussaint Mixed in 12-8;
>Transcribed from several Toussaint papers and books. Contains mixed density and genres.

DC subsets:
- DC Claves in 4/4;
- DC Claves in 2/2;
>This subset contains the same rhythmic patterns were is in 4/4 and the other in half time (2/2), which repeats 3 times in 12 seconds instead of 6 times in audio rendering;
>This subset contains a mixed variety of genres and densities (number of onsets per pattern). Moreover, some patterns have micro timing deviations characteristic of the genre;


This dataset contains:
- MIDI files of one bar loop of each rhythmic pattern;
- Audio files with 12sec. duration (6bars in 4/4 and 4bars in 12/8 at 120bpm) rendered in 48KHz 24bit mono;
- All patterns rendered with the same synthesiser (hihat sound) and same level in average.
