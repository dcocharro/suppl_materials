# Claves & Rhythmic Patterns Dataset

### This dataset contains:

- MIDI files of one bar/cycle/loop for each rhythmic pattern;
- Audio files with 12sec. duration (6bars in 4/4 and 4bars in 12/8 at 120bpm) rendered at 48KHz 24bit mono;
- All patterns rendered with the same synthesiser (hihat sound) and same level. 

All rhythmic patterns were transcribed from G. Toussaint published work, except the subsets named "DC Claves..." which were transcribed from different sources such as, music education books, websites and videos.



### G.Toussaint subsets:

- **Maximally Even Rhythms 12pulses 4onsets in 12-8;**
- **Maximally Even Rhythms 12pulses 4onsets in 4-4;**
  - This subset comprises rhythmic patterns with the same density and with maximally even distribution (a property observed in many euclidean rhythms).

- **Toussaint Mixed in 4-4;**
- **Toussaint Mixed in 12-8;**
  - Transcribed from several Toussaint papers and books. Contains mixed density and genres.
- **Toussaint World_Music_Journal 4-4**
  - This subset contains big variety of rhythms patterns found across many genres. The density spans from 5 onsets to 10 onsets in crescent order. This subset was published by G. Toussaint in *World Music Journal*, 4(2):1-30.



### DC subsets:

- **DC Claves in 4-4;**
- **DC Claves in 2-2;**
  - Both subsets contain the same rhythmic patterns were one is in 4/4 and the other in half time (2/2), which repeats 3 times in 12 seconds instead of 6 times (in 4/4);
    This subset contains a mixed variety of genres and densities (number of onsets per pattern). Moreover, a small number of patterns have <u>micro timing deviations</u> characteristic of the genre;
- **Metronomic Beat Subdivisions**
  - This subset contains evenly spanned metronomic subdivisions of 4n, 8n, 8nt, 16n and quintuplets.
