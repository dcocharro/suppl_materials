# DFT Grids

Computing the Frequency of each DFT bin(k) 



Compute the prime factors of a given meter at a stratification level: $4/4 = 16~2~2~2~2$

Get Bar length in Ticks: $(4/4 = 1920)$;  $4n=480ticks$

LCM (ofAllMeters): time domain N = 5040 

So we two sampling rates:

- from Ticks(4/4): Fs = 1920
- From LCM(meters) = 5040 





```
/*
DFTbinToFreq.js
This function takes the number of samples (N) and the sampling rate (f_s) as inputs 
and returns an array containing the frequency corresponding to each DFT bin.

## metricSync as a DFT multi-meter Grid



## DFT multi-meter Grid

The metricSync method can be explored as a multi-meter grid both in the time domain and in the frequency domain of the DFT.



Ticks allows to assess which bins equate to a valid metrical level (a rhythmic figure as grid)

Converting the bin(k) or n to ticks allows to assess which DFT components represent the relevants metrical levels
